Creating an Arduino library for store data in EEPROM

In every device there is issue of losing datas with power failure. To overcome it is used to store
all the datas in the EEPROM. So same functions related to storing method in EEPROM have
to be used in every device. That is a wasting time and increasing the complexity of the code.
To overcome this problem I am going to create an arduino library including all the functions
for storing methods of EEPROM.
